title: The Verb
---

Verbs in Galilean are sometimes confusing when contrasted with other dialects as well-established forms in Eastern Aramaic dialects evolved differently in Western dialects, which became even more pronounced in Galilean. 

[More examples.]

All verbs in Galilean Aramaic start off as three-letter roots which represent basic concepts (ex. *ktb* = "to write") upon which additional vowels, prefixes and suffixes are added. These patterns of inflection are based upon the following five things:

1. **Conjugation**; *Pə\`al*, *Pa\`\`el*, *Af`el*, etc..

2. **Tense**; Past, Future, Present, Passive Participle, or Infinitive.

3. **Gender**; Masculine or Feminine.

4. **Number**; Singular or Plural.

5. **Person**; First, Second, or Third.

## Parts of the Verb

### Conjugation

Galilean Aramaic, like other Aramaic languages, has three major Conjugations. These Conjugations determine the basic vowel pattern that the root takes when forming a Verb, and are traditionally represented by the root *p`l* ("to labor"). These three are:

| {% gal "p:(al" %} | {% gal "pa(.El" %} | {% gal ")ap(El" %} |
| :---------------: | :----------------: | :----------------: |
| ***Pə`al***[^1]   | ***Pa``el***       | ***'Af`el***       |
| General           | Intensive[^2]      | Causative          |

[^1]: Also sometimes referred to as the Hebrew *Qal*.
[^2]: Sometimes called "Doubled," making the three G, D, C.

*Originally* in older dialects of Aramaic, *Pə\`al* was the base form for all verbs (ex. "to walk"); *Pa\`\`el* was an "Intensive" whereby the action-meaning of the root was extended in some more intense or direct manner (ex. "to run"); and *'Af\`el*[^3] was a "Causative" whereby the action done was being provoked or caused by the actor (ex. "to chase").

[^3]: In Galilean there is evidence that the beginning *a* vowel was somewhat reduces for we find an *'Af`el* form vocalized as {% gal "t:\$kax" %} ⟶ *təškaḥ* in *FPT Exodus 22:3*.

Now, each these three Conjugations also have corresponding Passives:

| {% gal "):tp:(El" %} | {% gal "):tpa(>al" %} | {% gal "):t>ap(al" %} |
| :------------------: | :-------------------: | :-------------------: |
| ***'Əṯpə`el***       | ***'Əṯpa``al***       | ***'Əttaf`al***       |
| General<br>Passive   | Intensive<br>Passive  | Causative<br>Passive  |

Each of these worked much like how the passive voice works in English, but with General Passive (ex. "to be walked"), Intensive Passive (ex. "to be run"), and Causative Passive (ex. "to be chased").

The three Actives and three Passives make up the 6 most common Conjugational forms found in Aramaic languages. In many cases these distinctions still hold true in Galilean, but like with any language some verbs evolved into new or different shades of meaning, jumbling up activeness, passiveness, intensity, and causation. As such, each verb needs to be learned wits appropriate Conjugations and what each Conjugation means. There *are* also rarer Conjugations (*Po`el*, *Palpel*, and their Passives, etc.), but they are best learned as irregular verbs and memorized separately.

### Tense

In Galilean there are 3 major structural Tenses (*Past, Present,* and *Future*), 3 derived tenses (*Past Participle, Imperative,* and *Infinitive*). Besides those there are a number of Compound Tenses that are made with the combination of two verbs (usually including the verb {% gal "hwy" %} "to be").

### Gender

Identical to the Noun there are two Genders: *Masculine* and *Feminine*. There is no Neuter Gender in Aramaic. When it comes to expressing things of indeterminate gender (such as abstract concepts, or even where a gender is simply unknown) the general rule of thumb is that it defaults to the Masculine for physical or concrete things and the Feminine otherwise. There are always exceptions.

### Number

Also identical to the Noun there are two Numbers: *Singular* and *Plural*.

### Person

In Galilean, like all other Aramaic dialects, there are three Persons: *First, Second,* and *Third*.

## Lemma Form

The *lemma* (or "dictionary") form of Verbs is the *Pə`al* Masculine 3rd Person Singular Past Tense which represents the base 2- or 3-letter root (e.g. {% gal "k:tab" %} = *"he wrote"*). This is in contrast with English which uses the Infinitive (*"to write"*).

## Basic Tenses in *Pə`al*

The following paradigms outline the basic use of the tenses along with their basic forms in *Pə`al*. It's this paradigm that is built upon to create all other Conjugations. Pips (•) represent the 3 letters of the Verb's root.

### The Past Tense

|			| Singular               | Plural                   |
| :-------- | :--------------------: | :----------------------: |
| 1st Com.  | {% gal "XaXX]Et" %}    | {% gal "X:XaXnaN" %}     |
| 2nd Com.  | [^4]{% gal "X:XaXt" %} | [^5]{% gal "X:XaXtON" %} |
| 3rd Masc. | {% gal "X:XaX" %}      | [^6]{% gal "X:XaXUN" %}  |
| 3rd Fem.  | {% gal "XaXX\}at" %}   | {% gal "X:XaXEN" %}      |

[^4]: The Masculine suffix sometimes appears as the more archaic {% gal "-t>ah" %}.
[^5]: The Feminine suffix very rarely appears as the classical {% gal "-tEN" %} and the Masculine as {% gal "-tUN" %}, but otherwise appears to have merged into {% gal "-tON" %}.
[^6]: Sometimes {% gal "X:XaXU" %} "in the wild" due to scribal correction, but the listed form is more correct. (See [Kutscher (1976)](/bibliography#kutscher1976)) Also, the quality of the vowel of the suffix changes to {% gal "O" %} in III-{% gal "y" %} verbs and some II-{% gal "w" %} verbs that take {% gal "O" %} as their Stem Vowel (such as {% gal "dwr" %}).

The Past^[Like all Aramaic dialects, what we refer to here as the "Past" was originally a Perfect which expressed completeness of action, regardless of time. For the most part, it represents a Past Tense as it is used in English, but there are exceptions.] is formed by adding suffixes and vowels upon the root.

**The Stem Vowel.** Every tense in Galilean has its own Stem Vowel which is determined by the verb. Where in other dialects the vowel is usually correlated to whether the Verb is historically transitive or intransitive or if the vowel falls close to a "guttural" letter ({% gal "h x ( r" %} which tend to bend vowels towards {% gal "Xa" %}), in Galilean the Stem Vowels for each verb must simply be memorized.

In the Past Tense paradigm above the Stem Vowel is represented by the {% gal "Xa" %} on the second radical. With some verbs (such as {% gal "dxl" %} "to fear" or {% gal "yld" %} "to give birth") it can be {% gal "E" %}, and in very rare cases {% gal "O" %}.

**Stem Vowel Notation.** Since the two Stem Vowels that other derivative Tenses rely upon are the Past and the Future, we will express them by placing them in subscript next to the Verb's root. Thus -- {% gal "ktb" %}<small>(a,o)</small> "to write" -- expresses that the Verb {% gal "ktb" %} has {% gal "Xa" %} as its Past Stem Vowel and {% gal "O" %} as its Future Stem Vowel.

**Exercise.** Conjugate the following Verbs into the Past Tense using the appropriate Stem Vowel.

| | |
| :----------------------------------: | :----------------------------------: |
| {% gal "(bd" %} <small>(a,e)</small> | {% gal "$m(" %} <small>(a,a)<small>  |
| "to make/do"                         | "to hear/listen"                     |
| &nbsp; | |
| {% gal "ptx" %} <small>(a,a)</small> | {% gal "sbr" %} <small>(a,o)</small> |
| "to open"                            | "to think/hope"                      |

Galilean verbs can also take on {% gal "E" %} where {% gal "Xa" %} appears on the second radical above.

### The Present Tense

|	    | Singular           | Plural              |
| :---- | :----------------: | :-----------------: |
| Masc. | {% gal "XaXEX" %}  | {% gal "XaX:XIN" %} |
| Fem.  | {% gal "XaXXah" %} | {% gal "XaX:XaN" %} |

The Present is formed by taking the base root and "declining" it like an Absolute Noun to match the Subject in both Gender and Number. Unlike Eastern Aramaic dialects where the subject usually *follows* the Present Verb, in Galilean it usually *precedes* it. For example: {% gal "hU)" %} katEb} *hu' kaṯév* = "He writes."

**Stem Vowel.** The most common by far is {% gal "E" %}. In cases where it falls around gutturals (such as with the common {% gal ")mr" %} "to say") we find {% gal "Xa" %}.

**The Participle.** The Present was originally an Active Participle (*"writing," "going,"* etc.). In Galilean, however, it came to represent a Simple Present and from there developed a unique form of the Participle by preceding the Present with the particle {% gal "m:N" %} which takes on the meaning of "while" or "when."^[[See Kutscher (1976) p51](/bibliography#kutscher1976). Often this was interpreted by Eastern Aramaic speaking scribes as a mistake and the Verb was altered into an [Infinitive](#the-infinitive), so if an oddly-placed Infinitive is found in the wild it may have originally been a Participle.]

**Exercise.** Conjugate the following Verbs into the Present Tense by pairing each Personal Pronoun with the appropriate Present Tense form using the appropriate Stem Vowel ({% gal "Xa" %} when adjacent to a guttural [{% gal "h x ( r" %}], {% gal "E" %} otherwise).

| | |
| :----------------------------------: | :----------------------------------: |
| {% gal "ktb" %} <small>(a,o)</small> | {% gal "xzr" %} <small>(a,o)<small>  |
| "to write"                           | "to return/repeat"                   |
| &nbsp; | |
| {% gal "(br" %} <small>(a,o)</small> | {% gal "q+l" %} <small>(a,o)</small> |
| "to pass/cross"                      | "to kill"                            |

### The Future Tense

|			| Singular                                 | Plural                   |
| :-------- | :--------------------------------------: | :----------------------: |
| 1st Com.  | {% gal "):XXOX" %} or {% gal "n:XXOX" %} | {% gal "n:XXOX" %}       |
| 2nd Masc. | {% gal "t:XXOX" %}                       | {% gal "t:XX:XUN" %}     |
| 2nd Fem.  | {% gal "t:XX:XEN" %}                     | [^9]{% gal "t:XX:XUN" %} |
| 3rd Masc. | {% gal "y;XXOX" %}                       | {% gal "y;XX:XUN" %}     |
| 3rd Fem.  | {% gal "t:XXOX" %}                       | {% gal "y;XX:XaN" %}     |

[^9]: The Masculine and Feminine 2nd Person Plural have merged.

The Future^[In similar manner to the Past Tense, the Future originally indicated an Imperfect (incomplete action).] is formed primarily by adding prefixes upon the root.

The form {% gal "n:XXOX" %} to express the 1st Person Singular is unique to Palestinian Aramaic dialects and its origins are a bit fuzzy.^[It is believed to be a combination of the Pronoun {% gal "):nah" %} + the Imperfect (ex. {% gal "):nah ):ktOb" %} ⟶ {% gal "n:ktOb" %}). For a detailed examination of the possibilities of its origins, see [Fassberg (1990) pp.166-67](/bibliography#fassberg1990).]

**Stem Vowel.** The most common is {% gal "O" %}, as shown above, but it can also be {% gal "E" %} or {% gal "Xa" %} depending on the Verb.

**Exercise.** Conjugate the following Verbs into the Future Tense using the Stem Vowel in parentheses.

| | |
| :-----------------------------------: | :---------------------------------: |
| {% gal "$lx$" %} <small>(a,a)</small> | {% gal "dmK" %} <small>(a,e)<small> |
| "to send"                             | "to sleep"                          |
| &nbsp; | |
| {% gal "$bq" %} <small>(a,o)</small>  | {% gal "ptr" %} <small>(a,a)</small> |
| "to leave"                            | "to explain/interpret"               |


### The Imperative

|	        | Singular           | Plural                  |
| :-------- | :----------------: | :---------------------: |
| 2nd Masc. | {% gal "X:XOX" %}  | {% gal "X:X:XUN" %}     |
| 2nd Fem.  | {% gal "X:XOXI" %} | [^9]{% gal "X:X:XUN" %} |

The Imperative is for issuing direct commands. For polite commands, the [Future](#the-future-tense) is used instead.

**Stem Vowel.** Identical to the Future.

**Exercise.** Conjugate the Verbs listed under the Future Tense into the Imperative.

### The Past Participle

The first of the derived tenses, it is identical to the Present Tense, except that the vowel after the second radical is *always* {% gal "I" %} (and this acts *as* the Stem Vowel).

|	    | Singular            | Plural              |
| :---- | :-----------------: | :-----------------: |
| Masc. | {% gal "X:XIX" %}   | {% gal "X:XIXIN" %} |
| Fem.  | {% gal "X:XIXah" %} | {% gal "X:XIXaN" %} |

### The Infinitive

|                    |
| :----------------: |        
| {% gal "m:XXOX" %} |

The Infinitive usually has the same Stem Vowel as the Future and has a variety of uses in Galilean (predominantly how one would use the English Infinitive). The vowel on the {% gal "m" %} can sometimes lean towards {% gal "I" %}. 

**Stem Vowel.** The most common is what is found in the Future. However we often find {% gal "O" %} despite this.^[\citet[Kutscher (1976) p.29](/bibliography#kutscher1976)]

**The Modal.** The Infinitive can also be used to express a Modal "should," or "would" when used in conjunction with the Verb {% gal "hwy" %} "to be": 

> {% gal "mah h:wwah mEmar l:hON" %} = "What should he have said to them?"

| **Past Part.** |                      |            |                      |            |

|                || {% gal "m:ktOb" %}  | *məḵtóv*   |             						 |

## "Defective" *Pə`al* Verbs

The previous paradigms are the base forms one can expect from a Regular (sometimes called "Strong") Verb. There are several variations on this basic pattern that arise when certain "weak" letters appear in the root, and many of them are rather common:

### *Pə`al* I-*'* Verbs

These verbs begin with {% gal ")" %}:

> {% gal ")mr" %}<small>(a,a, Imp. o)</small> "to say," {% gal ")kl" %}<small>(a,o)</small> "to eat," {% gal ")zl" %}<small>(a,e)</small> "to go," etc..

In the **Future** and **Infinitive**, initial {% gal ")" %} lengthens to {% gal "E" %} (ex. {% gal ")mr" %}  → {% gal ")Emar" %}, {% gal "tEmar" %}, etc.) or is, less often, dropped ({% gal "t:mar" %}). "In the wild," however {% gal ")" %} can sometimes be retained in spelling ({% gal "te)mar" %}).

For example, {% gal ")mr" %}<small>(a,a, Imp. o)</small>:

| Future	     | Singular             |            | Plural               |            |
| :------------- | :------------------: | :--------: | :------------------: | :--------: |
| 1st Com.       | {% gal ")Emar" %}    | *'emár*    | {% gal "nEmar" %}    | *nemár*    |
|                | {% gal "nEmar" %}    | *nemár*    |                      |            |
| 2nd Masc.      | {% gal "tEmar" %}    | *temár*    | {% gal "tEm:rUN" %}  | *temərún*  |
| 2nd Fem.       | {% gal "tEm:rEN" %}  | *temərén*  | ↑                    | ↑          |
| 3rd Masc.      | {% gal "yEmar" %}    | *yemár*    | {% gal "yEm:rUN" %}  | *yemərún*  |
| 3rd Fem.       | {% gal "tEmar" %}    | *temár*    | {% gal "yEm:raN" %}  | *yemərán*  |
| **Infinitive** |                      |            |                      |            |
|                || {% gal "mEmar" %}   | *memár*    |             						 |

### *Pə`al* I-*y* Verbs

These verbs begin with {% gal "y" %}:

> {% gal "yd(" %}<small>(a,a)</small> "to know," {% gal "yhb" %}<small>(a,*)</small>^[The curious case of the verb {% gal "yhb" %}<small>(a,\*)</small> "to give" is that it is *never* used in the Future or Infinitive. In those cases, the suppletive verb {% gal "ntN" %}<small>(\*,e)</small> "to give" is employed instead (and, conversely, is not used otherwise).] "to give," {% gal "yld" %}<small>(e,a)</small> "to give birth," etc..

In the **Future** {% gal "y" %} is dropped and {% gal "y-" %} prefixes become consonantal ({% gal "yd(" %} → {% gal "y:dA(" %}, {% gal "t:dA(" %}, etc.).

In the **Imperative**, the initial {% gal "y" %} is dropped (ex. {% gal "yd(" %} → {% gal "dA(" %}, etc.).

In the **Infinitive** the {% gal "y" %} lengthens to *e*.

For example, {% gal "yd(" %}<small>(a,a)</small>:

| Future	     | Singular             |            | Plural               |            |
| :------------- | :------------------: | :--------: | :------------------: | :--------: |
| 1st Com.       | {% gal "):dA(" %}    | *'əḏa`*    | {% gal "n:dA(" %}    | *nəḏá`*    |
|                | {% gal "n:dA(" %}	| *nəḏá`*    |                      |            |
| 2nd Masc.      | {% gal "t:dA(" %}    | *təḏá`*    | {% gal "t:d:(UN" %}  | *təḏə`ún*  |
| 2nd Fem.       | {% gal "t:d:(EN" %}  | *təḏə`én*  | ↑                    | ↑          |
| 3rd Masc.      | {% gal "y:dA(" %}    | *yəḏá`*    | {% gal "y:d:(UN" %}  | *yəḏə`ún*  |
| 3rd Fem.       | {% gal "t:dA(" %}    | *təḏá`*    | {% gal "y:d:(aN" %}  | *yəḏə`án*  |
| **Imperative** |                      |            |                      |            |
| 2nd Masc.      | {% gal "dA(" %}      | *dá`*      | {% gal "dA(UN" %}    | *dá`un*    |
| 2nd Fem.       | {% gal "dA(I" %}     | *dá`i*     | ↑                    | ↑          |
| **Infinitive** |                      |            |                      |            |
|                || {% gal "mEdA(" %}   | *medá`*    |             						 |

### *Pə`al* I-*n* Verbs

These verbs begin with {% gal "n" %}:

> {% gal "npq" %}<small>(a,o)</small> "to go out," {% gal "nsb" %}<small>(a,a)</small> "to take," {% gal "npl" %}<small>(a,o)</small>$ "to fall," etc..

In the **Future**, {% gal "n" %} is dropped ({% gal "npq" %} → {% gal "y;pOq" %}, {% gal "t:pOq" %}, etc.). Sometimes it can be still found in spelling, but it's rare.

In the **Infinitive**, {% gal "n" %} is dropped and the initial vowel lengthened to {% gal "E" %}.

In the **Imperative**, the initial {% gal "n" %} is also dropped (ex. {% gal "npq" %} → {% gal "pOq" %}, etc.).

For example, {% gal "nsb" %}<small>(a,a)</small>:

### *Pə`al* II-*'* Verbs

These verbs have {% gal ")" %} as their middle letter:

> {% gal "$)l" %} "to ask," (the most common) etc..

Where it would *seem* that this would be a case of irregularity, the {% gal ")" %} is treated like any normal consonant.


### *Pə`al* II-*w* Verbs

These verbs have {% gal "w" %} as their middle letter (rarely {% gal "y" %}):

> {% gal "qwM" %}<small>(a,u)</small> "to stand,"  {% gal "mwt" %}<small>(i,u)</small> "to die," etc..

In the **Past**, **Future**, and **Infinitive** the {% gal "w" %} is dropped and replaced by the Stem Vowel (ex. {% gal "qwM" %} → {% gal "qaM" %}, {% gal "y;qUM" %}, etc.).

In the **Present** the {% gal "w" %} in the Masculine Singular becomes {% gal "-ayye-" %} (ex. {% gal "qwM" %} → {% gal "qayyeM" %}).^[Sometimes {% gal "-a)E-" %} in the wild.]

In the **Past Participle** the {% gal "w" %} is replaced with {% gal "I" %}.

For example, {% gal "qwM" %}<small>(a,u)</small>:

### *Pə`al* II-*yy,ww* Verbs

These verbs have a consonantal {% gal "ww" %} or {% gal "yy" %} in the middle, which are treated like the middle radical of a Strong Verb. Where they are usually in *Pa\`el*, the verb {% gal "cwwx" %}<small>(a,a)</small> "to call," appears regularly in *Pə`al*. 

The only potential irregularity would occur with a II-*yy* verb if it were to appear in the Present or Past Participle; however, no examples exist in the corpus.

### *Pə`al* III-*y* Verbs

Perhaps the most common of irregular verbs, these end with {% gal "y" %} and are all *(a,e)*:

> {% gal "b(y" %}<small>(a,e)</small> "to ask/want,"  {% gal "xmy" %}<small>(a,e)</small> "to see," {% gal "cly" %}<small>(a,e)</small> "to pray," etc..

Because of their final vowel, a number of marked changes occur with suffixes:

In the **Past** the ending merges with the final vowel in the 1st. Com.. It is dropped with the 3rd Masc. Sing. which becomes {% gal "-ah" %} *-ah*, the 3rd Fem. Sing. which becomes {% gal "-at" %} *-aṯ*, the 3rd Masc. Pl. which becomes {% gal "-ON" %} *-on*. In the 3rd Fem. Pl. it becomes consonantal as {% gal "-yyaN" %} *-yan*.

In the **Present** and the **Past Participle** the {% gal "y" %} is treated as the second vowel in the Masc. Sing. and becomes consonantal in all other endings. Quite often in the Masc. Pl. the final {% gal "-N" %} is dropped.^[For a detailed examination of this phenomenon with examples, see [Kutscher (1979) 3§A, pp.43-51](/bibliography#kutscher1976).]

In the **Future**, like the Past, the 3rd Masc. Pl. and Fem. Pl. endings become {% gal "-ON" %} *-on* and {% gal "-yyaN" %} *-yan*.

For example, {% gal "cly" %}<small>(a,e)</small>:

### *Pə`al* III-*n* Verbs

These verbs have {% gal "n" %} as their final letter:

> {% gal "zbN" %}<small>(a,o)</small> "to buy,"  {% gal "t(N" %}<small>(a,o)</small> "to lift/carry," {% gal "tqN" %}<small>(a,o)</small> "to be in good order/proper," etc..

There is only a rather subtle difference in the 1st Person Past Tense, where the {% gal "-naN" %} ending merges with the final {% gal "-N" %}:

<div style="text-align:center;">
{% gal "zbN" %} → {% gal "z;bannaN" %} → {% gal "z;banaN" %}  <i>zəḇánan</i>
</div>


### *Pə`al* III-Doubled Verbs

These verbs have the same letter for their second and last radicals.

## Unusual Forms

### Strong Middle Vowel

Some Verbs have a middle vowel that is treated as a consonant. In these cases, it is represented by a {% gal "ww" %} or {% gal "yy" %} and they are almost exclusively *Pa``el*.

Common Verbs in this class include {% gal "syy(" %} ("to aid, support"), {% gal "cwwx" %} ("to cry out, shout"), etc.. The only difference is when vowels collide, as {% gal "w" %} or {% gal "y" %} in some cases may be absorbed into the strong vowel (either orthographically or in speech).

### Quadraliterals

Some Verbs have four radicals and are derived from Nouns, ancient Verbal forms that have perturbed over time, or are new innovations. Examples of these you will occasionally come across include {% gal "$yzb" %} ("to save"), {% gal "prns" %} ("to sustain, support"), {% gal "trgM" %} ("to translate"), {% gal "hyymN" %} (with a strong {% gal "y" %}, "to believe, trust"), and {% gal "qntr" %} ("to rebuke, chide").

These tend to be conjugated similarly to *Pa\`\`el* and *'Əṯpa``al*, and since the second radical in a Quadraliteral Verb is often a Vowel ({% gal "y" %}, {% gal "w" %}, or a strong {% gal "yy" %}), a nasal ({% gal "m" %} or {% gal "n" %}), or a liquid ({% gal "r" %} or {% gal "l" %}) it is usually treated as the first part of the doubled radical.

### Unusual Forms

There are also a number of rare Verbal patterns that are derived from roots with three radicals, and you may come across these occasionally:

#### *Palpel* & *'Əṯpalpal*

The *Palpel* comes from a Verb with only two strong radicals (such as II-w or III-Doubled) where they are duplicated. For example, the Verb {% gal "+wl" %} ("to cast, throw") in *Palpel* becomes {% gal "+l+l" %} ("to lift, handle, move around, confuse") where the Verb {% gal "gll" %} ("to roll") becomes {% gal "glgl" %} (also "to roll" but more common).

#### *Polel* & *'Əṯpolal*

The *Polel* form of the Verb is quite rare, is formed similarly to *Palpel*, but as its name suggests it has a first vowel of {% gal "w" %} and a doubling of the last radical.


## Irregular Verbs

The following Verbs listed here simply defy the normal paradigms, and as a result must be memorized.

### *'iṯ* - "To Have"

Where treated more like a genuine Verb and conjugated in other Aramaic dialects, the word {% gal ")It" %} ("there is") is treated more like a Particle in Galilean. However, given its principal use as the Verb "to have," I have opted to handle it here.

When combined with {% gal "l:-" %} + the appropriate Pronominal Suffix, we arrive at the following:

|			    |	Singular	    	| 				| Plural                  |       	    |
| :------------ | :-------------------: | :-----------: | :---------------------: | :---------: |
|1st Com.		|	{% gal ")It lI" %}	| "I have"		|	{% gal ")It laN" %}   | "We have"   |
|2nd Masc.		|	{% gal ")It laK" %}	| "You have"	|	{% gal ")It l:kON" %} | "You have"  |
|2nd Fem.		|	{% gal ")It lEK" %}	| "You have"	|	{% gal ")It l:kEN" %} | "You have"  |
|3rd Masc.		|	{% gal ")It lEh" %}	| "He has"		|	{% gal ")It l:hON" %} | "They have" |
|3rd Fem.		|	{% gal ")It lah" %}	| "She has"		|	{% gal ")It l:hEN" %} | "They have" |

To express the **Negative** ("does not have") one uses {% gal "lEt" %}^[Originally a combination of {% gal "la)" %} and {% gal ")It" %}.] (ex. {% gal "lEt lEh s:par" %} = "He doesn't have a book").

To express the **Past** or **Future** of "to have" one uses {% gal "hwy" %} in the 3rd Person Singular (either {% gal "h:wwuN" %} or {% gal "y;hwwE" %}) + {% gal "l:-" %} and the appropriate Pronominal Suffix in similar fashion (ex. {% gal "h:wwuN lI" %} = "I had") and for the negative one precedes it with {% gal "la)" %}.


### Galilean Verbs of Note

There are a number of distinct dialectical features in Galilean where certain verbs are used or not used in contexts that would be common in other dialects.

#### *swm*
The verb {% gal "swM" %} ("to put, to place") where very common in Eastern Aramaic dialects is completely absent from Galilean and other Western dialects.^[For an ironic example, see the Syriac Peshitta's rendition of Luke 23:46.] Instead the idea of "putting" or "placing" is expressed with the Verb {% gal "yhb" %} ("to give") plus the Particle {% gal "(al" %}, with Pronominal Suffixes when appropriate, or by using the verb {% gal "msr" %} ("to deliver") which is less common.
