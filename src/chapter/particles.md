## The Proclitic Particles (*də-, lə-, bə-, wə-,* & *kə-*)

| | | | | |
| :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: |
| {% gal "d:-" %} | {% gal "l:-" %} | {% gal "b:-" %} | {% gal "w;-" %} | {% gal "k:-" %} |
| *də-*           | *lə-*           | *bə-*           | *wə-*           | *kə-*           |
| of,             | to,             | with,           | and             | like,           |
| who,            | for,            | in              |                 | as,             |
| because         | unto            |                 |                 | according to    |

The Proclitic Particles are particles that are letters that are prefixed upon words that bestow additional meaning. The majority of them are prepositions and conjunctions.

## Notes About *də-*

Out of all of the Proclitic Particles, *də-* is the most complex. It is a shortened form of the archaic {% gal "dI" %},^[Which is only employed in translational texts, such as the Palestinian Targums.] it is a particle that has abundant use:

1. As a **Genitive Particle**, roughly equivalent to "of."
> {% gal "sEprah d:malkah" %} *sefráh **də**malkah* = "The book **of** the king."

2. As a **Relative Pronoun**, "who," "which," or "of whom."
> {% gal "gabrah dA):tah" %}  *gavrah **da**'əṯah* = "The man *who* came."

3. As a **Conjunction**, as "that," "so that," "because" or "for."
> {% gal "xamEt dan:pal" %}  *ḥaméṯ **da**nəfal* = "I saw **that** he fell".

## With Pronominal Suffixes

Out of the Proclitic Particles, only {% gal "l:-" %} and {% gal "b:-" %} can take on Pronominal Suffixes. The others are only found affixed to Nouns, Pronouns, and Verbs.

When {% gal "l:-" %} is combined with Pronominal Suffixes it represents the **Objective Pronoun**:

|               |                  | Singular |                   | Plural    |
| :------------ | ---------------: | :------- | ----------------: | :-------- |
| **1st Com.**  | {% gal "lI" %}   | (to) me  | {% gal "laN" %}   | (to) us   |
| **2nd Masc.** | {% gal "laK" %}  | (to) you | {% gal "l:kON" %} | (to) you  |
| **2nd Fem.**  | {% gal "lEK" %}  | (to) you | {% gal "l:kEN" %} | (to) you  |
| **3rd Masc.** | {% gal "lEh" %}  | (to) him | {% gal "l:hON" %} | (to) them |
| **3rd Fem.**  | {% gal "lah]" %} | (to) her | {% gal "l:hEN" %} | (to) them |

When {% gal "b:-" %} is combined with Pronominal Suffixes it represents **"with," "in,"** or **"through"** followed by the **Objective Pronoun**:

|               |                  | Singular    |                   | Plural       |
| :------------ | ---------------: | :---------- | ----------------: | :----------- |
| **1st Com.**  | {% gal "bI" %}   | with/in me  | {% gal "baN" %}   | with/in us   |
| **2nd Masc.** | {% gal "baK" %}  | with/in you | {% gal "b:kON" %} | with/in you  |
| **2nd Fem.**  | {% gal "bEK" %}  | with/in you | {% gal "b:kEN" %} | with/in you  |
| **3rd Masc.** | {% gal "bEh" %}  | with/in him | {% gal "b:hON" %} | with/in them |
| **3rd Fem.**  | {% gal "bah]" %} | with/in her | {% gal "b:hEN" %} | with/in them |


## Multiple Prefixes

Multiple Proclitic Particles can be added to the same word to express a variety of meanings. For example:

> {% gal "malkah" %} ⟶ "the king"

> {% gal "l:malkah" %} ⟶ "unto the king"

> {% gal "dal:malkah" %} ⟶ "that which (is) unto the king"

> {% gal "k:dal:malkah" %} ⟶ "like that which (is) unto the king"

> {% gal "wAk:dal:malkah" %} ⟶ "and like that which (is) unto the king"

etc.

## The Rule of *šəwa`*

As you have probably noticed, as Proclitic Particles are added upon a word, the vowel alternates between *šəwa\`* and *pəṯaḥ*. The rule of determining which is used can be condensed to "don't put two <i>šəwa`</i>s in a row."^[See [Fassberg (1990) §33, pp.107-110](/bibliography#fassberg1990) for a full set of examples of this rule.] For example:

If the next syllable is a *šəwa`*, use *pəṯaḥ*. 

> {% gal "m:lEK" %} "(a) king" ⟶ {% gal "lam:lEK" %} "to (a) king."

But if the next syllable has any other vowel use *šəwa`*.

> {% gal "malkah" %} "the king" ⟶ {% gal "l:malkah" %} "to the king."

As you can see from the examples in the previous section on Multiple Prefixes, you work backwards with each addition.

## Independent Particles

There are also a number of particles that are separate from other words. 

[More stuff here...]

## The Particle *mən*

The particle {% gal "m:N" %} predominantly means "from" is used in a variety of ways that indicates a point of origin ({% gal "):nah m:N galIlah" %} = "I am from Galilee"). 

When it takes on suffixes, the vowel lengthens and the *nun* doubles  ({% gal "mIn.-" %}) hence:

|               |                     | Singular |                     | Plural    |
| :------------ | ------------------: | :------- | ------------------: | :-------- |
| **1st Com.**  | {% gal "mIn.I" %}   | from me  | {% gal "mIn>aN" %}  | from us   |
| **2nd Masc.** | {% gal "mIn>aK" %}  | from you | {% gal "mIn.kON" %} | from you  |
| **2nd Fem.**  | {% gal "mIn.EK" %}  | from you | {% gal "mIn.kEN" %} | from you  |
| **3rd Masc.** | {% gal "mIn.Eh" %}  | from him | {% gal "mIn.hON" %} | from them |
| **3rd Fem.**  | {% gal "mIn>ah]" %} | from her | {% gal "mIn.hEN" %} | from them |

It can also be used in a **partitive** sense.

> {% gal "xad m:N )axOI" %} = "One from/of his brothers."

> {% gal "t:rayyiN m:N s:qah" %} = "Three from the sack."

It can also be used to express **superlatives** in the following manner.

> {% gal "rab m:N" %} = "Bigger/greater than..."

> {% gal "y;tIr m:N" %} = "More than..."

> {% gal "p:rah m:N" %} = "Less than..."^[{% gal "p:rah" %} is a loan from the Greek παρά.]

> {% gal "z;(Or m:N" %} = "Smaller/less than..."

And to express something the "biggest" or "smallest" it's always "from" a plural or "from all" ({% gal "m:N kal" %}):

> {% gal "rabah mIn.kON" %} = "The greatest among you."

> {% gal "z;(OrAh m:N kal" %} = "Smallest (of all)."


# The Particle *`əm*

The particle {% gal "(:M" %} indicates "(together) with" or "at the time of." When combined with Pronominal Suffixes, the {% gal "m" %} doubles:

|               |                     | Singular |                     | Plural    |
| :------------ | ------------------: | :------- | ------------------: | :-------- |
| **1st Com.**  | {% gal "(:m.I" %}   | with me  | {% gal "(:m>aN" %}  | with us   |
| **2nd Masc.** | {% gal "(:m>aK" %}  | with you | {% gal "(:m.kON" %} | with you  |
| **2nd Fem.**  | {% gal "(:m.EK" %}  | from you | {% gal "(:m.kEN" %} | with you  |
| **3rd Masc.** | {% gal "(:m.Eh" %}  | with him | {% gal "(:m.hON" %} | with them |
| **3rd Fem.**  | {% gal "(:m>ah]" %} | with her | {% gal "(:m.hEN" %} | with them |


## The Particle *`al*

The particle {% gal "(al" %} means "unto," "upon," "against," or "concerning" depending on context.

> {% gal "yAtEb (al kEpah" %} = "Sitting upon the rock."

It, too, can take on Pronominal Suffixes, however make note that it takes their *plural* forms.

|               |                     | Singular |                     | Plural    |
| :------------ | ------------------: | :------- | ------------------: | :-------- |
| **1st Com.**  | {% gal "(alayy" %}  | upon me  | {% gal "(alEnaN" %} | upon us   |
| **2nd Masc.** | {% gal "(alEK" %}   | upon you | {% gal "(alEkON" %} | upon you  |
| **2nd Fem.**  | {% gal "(alayyK" %} | upon you | {% gal "(alEkEN" %} | upon you  |
| **3rd Masc.** | {% gal "(alOI" %}   | upon him | {% gal "(alEhON" %} | upon them |
| **3rd Fem.**  | {% gal "(alEh" %}   | upon her | {% gal "(alEhEN" %} | upon them |

## The Particle *la'*

The particle {% gal "la)" %} is the Negative Particle, representing "no" or "not." It is used as a generic negative:

> {% gal "):mar lEh la)" %} = "He said to him, `No!'"

And can be casually used in simple sentences:

> {% gal "la) s:par hU)" %} or {% gal "la) hU) s:par" %} = "It's not a book."

When negating Verbs, it usually comes directly before:

> {% gal "la) ):tah lI" %} = "He didn't come to me."

When combined with the word {% gal "k:lOM" %} ("something") as in {% gal "la) k:lOM" %} it means "nothing," or can be used to strengthen a negation:

> {% gal "la) ):mar lEh k:lOM" %} = "He didn't say anything to him." or "He didn't speak to him at all."

When used in the series {% gal "w:la)" %} ...{% gal "la)" %} it means "neither... nor":

> {% gal "la) d:N w:la) d:N" %} = "Neither this, nor that."

When combined with the particle {% gal "d:-" %} it means "without":

> {% gal "d:la) mazON" %} = "Without food."

And it is used in a variety of other ways in combination with other particles as described in their own sections.

## The Particle *diḏ-*

The particle {% gal "dId-" %} originates from the classical {% gal "dIl-" %}^[literally, "That which is to..."] and is only used when a Possessive Suffix, for whatever reason, won't work. It indicates simple possession where there is no Noun, or where using a Possessive Suffix would be awkward such as on a loan-word whose ending wouldn't fit normal Declensions.

|               |                    | Singular |                    | Plural |
| :------------ | -----------------: | :------- | -----------------: | :----- |
| **1st Com.**  | {% gal "dIdI" %}   | mine     | {% gal "dIdaN" %}  | ours   |
| **2nd Masc.** | {% gal "dIdaK" %}  | yours    | {% gal "dIdkON" %} | yours  |
| **2nd Fem.**  | {% gal "dIdEK" %}  | yours    | {% gal "dIdkEN" %} | yours  |
| **3rd Masc.** | {% gal "dIdEh" %}  | his      | {% gal "dIdhON" %} | theirs |
| **3rd Fem.**  | {% gal "dIdah]" %} | hers     | {% gal "dIdhEN" %} | theirs |

## The Particle *kal*

The particle {% gal "kal" %} *kal* means "all."

It can take the Definite ending like a Masculine Declension C Noun, lengthening the {% gal "•a" %} vowel to {% gal "O" %} and it becomes {% gal "kOlAh" %} *kolah* meaning "everything."^[This is in contrast to other Aramaic dialects where "everything" is usually some form of {% gal "kl md(M" %} or {% gal "klmdM" %}.]
