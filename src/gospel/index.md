title: "Galilean Aramaic Gospels"
---

The ***Aramaic Words Translation*** is an effort of taking a public domain version of the Canonical Gospels and interpolating wherever Jesus or his followers are speaking with a simple transliteration of their words in a reconstruction of their original language, and then analyzing those words for any word plays or other significance beyond what can be gleaned from the original Greek text.

### Abbreviations & Notes:

The following texts were used as a foundation for the reconstructions have been consulted and aligned in the apparatus under each Galilean Aramaic reconstruction where they are available. The Greek New Testament served as the structural base for each reconstruction, where the Syriac and Christian Palestinian Aramaic (CPA) served as examples for proper rendition of tenses. Galilean vocabulary and grammatical structures were then utilized when those in Syriac and CPA deviated from accepted forms, but CPA (as a Western dialect) was much closer in form to Galilean to begin with and in a fair number of cases required little modification outside of orthography.
