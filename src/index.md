title: What is This?
---

About 10 years ago I set out to create a much needed grammar on the Galilean Aramaic language. 8 years ago I finished a draft -- and then, [a bit discouraged](http://aramaicnt.org/2022/03/22/state-of-the-site/), I put it aside and did nothing with it.

This year (2025) I have decided to finally publish it on this website for anyone to read, which required converting all of the lovely [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) files I had written -- a necessity before more recent font rendering solutions --  into something more archival in nature.

The current site is developed and deployed in [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), a static site generator that takes Markdown files (which are very future-proof and easy to read) and builds them into a flat-file HTML and CSS website.

As of the initial posting, this document is not edited. There are typos. There are mistakes. There be dragons left to be slain. Check the news below for progress. I may at some point build an RSS feed for it.

However, the code for the *entire thing* is now [available up on GitHub](https://github.com/SteveCaruso/galilean-grammar) and I will accept pull requests for updates and ammendations.

I hope that you, dear reader, are able to make good use of this.
