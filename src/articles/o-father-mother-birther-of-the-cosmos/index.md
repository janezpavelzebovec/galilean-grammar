It begins, as so many modern inquiries do, with a question followed by a simple Internet search:

> ***If Christ spoke Aramaic, what would the Lord's Prayer be like in his native tongue - in the "original Aramaic"?***

A quick trip to Google later and one quickly encounters a bewildering array of purported Aramaic translations. Driven by promises of unlocking hidden truths, these portrayals often present formulations strikingly different from established scholarship and tradition, accompanied by elaborate explanations of supposed 'hidden meanings' embedded within the Aramaic language or assertions about its inherent mystical properties. And where what drives the *question* is a desire for deeper meaning in an ancient and more authentic Jesus, all of these portrayals are rather young, only cropping up in the last hundred years or so.

This article explores this phenomenon, examining what one initially finds in a casual online search to a deeper examination of the challenges surrounding the reconstruction of the original Aramaic Lord’s Prayer and the often-misleading narratives that have emerged in its pursuit.

## Examples:

Here are a number of examples that can be found with a quick look, and we can immediately see the variety.

### 1) "The Prayer To Our Father"

<center>

*(in the original Aramaic)*

**Abwûn**
“Oh Thou, from whom the breath of life comes,

**d’bwaschmâja**
who fills all realms of sound, light and vibration.

**Nethkâdasch schmach**
May Your light be experienced in my utmost holiest.

**Têtê malkuthach.**
Your Heavenly Domain approaches.

**Nehwê tzevjânach aikâna d’bwaschmâja af b’arha.**
Let Your will come true – in the universe (all that vibrates)
just as on earth (that is material and dense).

**Hawvlân lachma d’sûnkanân jaomâna.**
Give us wisdom (understanding, assistance) for our daily need,

**Waschboklân chaubên wachtahên aikâna**
**daf chnân schwoken l’chaijabên.**
detach the fetters of faults that bind us, (karma)
like we let go the guilt of others.

**Wela tachlân l’nesjuna**
Let us not be lost in superficial things (materialism, common temptations),

**ela patzân min bischa.**
but let us be freed from that what keeps us off from our true purpose.

**Metol dilachie malkutha wahaila wateschbuchta l’ahlâm almîn.**
From You comes the all-working will, the lively strength to act,
the song that beautifies all and renews itself from age to age.

**Amên.**
Sealed in trust, faith and truth.
(I confirm with my entire being)

A Translation of “Our Father” directly from Aramaic into English

*O cosmic Birther of all radiance and vibration. Soften the ground of our being and carve out a space within us where your Presence can abide.*

*Fill us with your creativity so that we may be empowered to bear the fruit of your mission.*

*Let each of our actions bear fruit in accordance with our desire.*

*Endow us with the wisdom to produce and share what each being needs to grow and flourish.*

*Untie the tangled threads of destiny that bind us, as we release others from the entanglement of past mistakes.*

*Do not let us be seduced by that which would divert us from our true purpose, but illuminate the opportunities of the present moment.*

*For you are the ground and the fruitful vision, the birth, power and fulfillment, as all is gathered and made whole once again.*

</center>

### 3) "Lords Prayer, from the original Aramaic"

<center>

*Translation by Neil Douglas-Klotz in Prayers of the Cosmos*

O Birther! Father- Mother of the Cosmos

Focus your light within us – make it useful.

Create your reign of unity now-

through our fiery hearts and willing hands

Help us love beyond our ideals

and sprout acts of compassion for all creatures.

Animate the earth within us: we then

feel the Wisdom underneath supporting all.

Untangle the knots within

so that we can mend our hearts’ simple ties to each other.

Don’t let surface things delude us,

But free us from what holds us back from our true purpose.

Out of you, the astonishing fire,

Returning light and sound to the cosmos.

Amen.

</center>

### 4) "Lords Prayer, from Aramaic into Old English"

<center>

Translation by G.J.R. Ouseley from *The Gospel of the Holy Twelve*

Our Father-Mother Who art above and within:
Hallowed be Thy Name in twofold Trinity.
In Wisdom, Love and Equity Thy Kingdom come to all.
Thy will be done, As in Heaven so in Earth.
Give us day by day to partake of Thy holy Bread, and the fruit of the living Vine.
As Thou dost forgive us our trespasses, so may we forgive others who trespass against us.
Shew upon us Thy goodness, that to others we may shew the same.
In the hour of temptation, deliver us from evil.
Amun.

## What Do These Have in Common?

These contemporary "translations" into Aramaic, championed by figures such as George Lamsa, Neil Douglas Klotz, and G.J.R. Ouseley, often exploit a general lack of public familiarity with the Aramaic language, presenting authors as unchallenged authorities -- and due to the nature of the Internet they are posted and re-posted, sometimes without any kind of provenance.

However, scholarly analysis indicates these works are not based on verifiable Aramaic prayer traditions but rather stem from the "Aramaic Mysticism" movement -- an attempt to reconstruct early Christian spirituality centered on the presumed hidden knowledge and layered meanings within the Aramaic language of Jesus. These interpretations often posit subtle wordplay and "mystical" double meanings that lack rigorous textual support. 

In short, most of these variant readings simply do not hold up to any form of scrutiny.

## What *Does* the Prayer Actually Say?

Addressing the claim of an "Original Aramaic Lord's Prayer" requires first clarifying which tradition is being referenced, because several Aramaic versions exist historically. 

The most commonly cited is the one found within the Syriac Peshitta, often purported to be the definitive "Original." The Syriac Peshitta is a standard textual recension of the Bible in Classical Syriac, a dialect of Aramaic, and holds significant importance within Syriac Christianity. Completed primarily in the 5th century CE, it serves as the liturgical text for numerous Eastern Christian denominations and is considered the most widely used and authoritative version of the Bible in the Syriac tradition.

Another significant Aramaic version appears in the Old Syriac Gospels (OS), found within manuscripts like the Sinaitic Palimpsest and the Curetonian texts. This dialect predates the Peshitta (the language it's written in can be as early as the 3rd century CE) and is generally considered a source for the latter's compilation. While the OS version exhibits minor differences in wording and order compared to the Peshitta, the differences are trivial and essentially convey the same core meaning.

## The Syriac Lord's Prayer

The following text is what each of the above examples are purportedly based on -- the version of the Prayer as found in Matthew of the Syriac Peshitta, along with a straightforward translation. Any possible variants are cited in footnotes:

<center>

ܐܒܘܢ ܕܒܫܡܝܐ
*'avun də-va-šmayyā'*
Our father who (is) in heaven,

ܢܬܩܕܫ ܫܡܟ
*neṯqaddaš šmāḵ*
May your name be holy,

ܬܐܬܐ ܡܠܟܘܬܟ
*te'ṯe' malḵuṯāḵ*
May your kingdom come,

ܢܗܘܐ ܨܒܝܢܟ
*nehwe' çevyānāḵ*
May your will be (done),

ܐܝܟܢܐ ܕܒܫܡܝܐ
*'aykannā' də-va-šmayyā'*
As in heaven,

ܐܦ ܒܐܪܥܐ
*'āf b-a'rˁā'*
Also on Earth.

ܗܒ ܠܢ ܠܚܡܐ
*hav lan laḥmā'*
Give us bread

ܕܣܘܢܩܢܢ ܝܘܡܢܐ
*də-sunqānan yaumānā'*
Of our need today.

ܘܫܒܘܩ ܠܢ ܚܘܒܝܢ
*wə-švuq lan ḥaubayn*
And forgive us our sins/debts,

ܐܝܟܢܐ ܕܐܦ ܚܢܢ
*'aykannā' d-'āf ḥnan*
Also like we,

ܫܒܩܢ ܠܚܝܒܝܢ
*švaqan l-ḥayyāvayn*
Forgive our debtors.

ܘܠܐ ܬܥܠܢ ܠܢܣܝܘܢܐ
*wə-lā' taˁlan lə-nesyunā'*
And do not let us enter temptation.

ܐܠܐ ܦܨܢ ܡܢ ܒܝܫܐ
*'ellā' paççān men bišā'*
But deliver us from evil.^[Or, "the Evil One" here it can be personified.]

ܡܛܠ ܕܕܝܠܟ ܗܝ ܡܠܟܘܬܐ
*meṭṭul də-ḏilāḵ hi' malḵuṯā'*
Because yours is the Kingdom,

ܘܚܝܠܐ ܘܬܫܒܘܚܬܐ
*wə-ḥaylā' wə-ṯešbuḵtā'*
And the power and the glory,

ܠܥܠܡ ܥܠܡܝܢ
*lə-ˁālam ˁālmin*
Forever (and) ever,

ܐܡܝܢ
*'ameyn*
Amen.

So from here we can see that the precision of Classical Syriac, a language well suited to theological nuance but governed by grammatical structure and rules, leaves little space for the expansive interpretations often attributed to it. Instead of unlocking mystical secrets, the careful examination of the Peshitta and other reliable Syriac manuscripts reveals a prayer rooted in historical context and conveying a consistent, though layered, meaning that aligns with broader scriptural themes. 

This isn't to diminish the spiritual significance of the Lord’s Prayer, but rather to underscore the importance of approaching its reconstruction with textual integrity and a critical awareness of the potential for modern biases to shape our understanding.

## The Catch

But herein lies the catch: The major problem with working from the Syriac versions that exist is that Classical Syriac -- while it *is* Aramaic -- is not "the language of Jesus" (that being [Galilean](/)) and therefore *cannot* be the original in any meaningful sense. As I had mentioned earlier, the language of the Peshitta and even the Old Syriac^[Whose name is a misnomer, as it is not written in actual Old Syriac which would have been contemporary to Christ, but early Classical Syriac. It is "Old" in the sense of "compared to the Peshitta."] is far too young and from a geographical location hundreds of miles removed from Christ, himself.

Furthermore, no Galilean Aramaic version of the prayer from antiquity presently exists. [My own efforts at reconstruction of the prayer in Galilean](/articles/lords-prayer-in-galilean-aramaic) have yielded results that have no meaningful theological differences nor bestow any further possible "wiggle room" to give any possibility to these imaginative renditions of the prayer.

## Conclusion

So, the quest to uderstand the ‘original’ Aramaic Lord’s Prayer, while born of a sincere desire for deeper understanding, highlights the *vital* importance of rigor in study -- ­especially in the Internet age.

The proliferation of these "mystical" renderings, often divorced from sound philological principles, ultimately obscures rather than illuminates the prayer's profound theological and historical significance, diverting attention from the carefully constructed meaning embedded within the conventional "accepted" tradition. So the idea that "O Father-Mother Birther of the Cosmos" is what Christ somehow truly meant to express *remains* a fiction.

That's pretty much it.
